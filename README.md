Case 2: Urban World (55%)
Urban World is a garment manufacturing company located in Indonesia. Urban World makes a variety of branded products sold worldwide. The garment manufacturing industry is primarily engaged in designing, cutting, and sewing garments from fabric. Most employees are paid on an hourly basis. Employees receive yearly reviews to evaluate performance and determine an appropriate pay increase. Urban Worldâ€™s payroll is processed by the corporate payroll department from input documents prepared by Urban World. The following HR and payroll procedures are related to the hourly payroll employees at Urban World:

1.0 Recruiting and Hiring Process
Department supervisors start to request for additional employees by filling out a three-part employee requisition form. After it is completed, the department supervisor signs it, files a copy by date and gives the remaining two copies to the production supervisor. The production supervisor reviews and signs the documents and gives them to the HR manager. The HR manager reviews the request with the division controller. They both sign the requisition. The pay rate for the job also is determined at that time and included in the requisition. If the requisition is approved, the HR manager initiates hiring procedures by placing advertisements in local papers and announcing the opening internally. The applicants send their resumes and CV to HR. The HR manager and the supervisor interview the selected applicants together. They then evaluate the applicants and make selection. The HR manager and the employee fill out the two-part wage and deduction form. The HR manager files a copy of the wage and deduction form and the personnel requisition by employee name. The remaining copies of each form are given to the division accountant.

2.0 Performance Evaluation Process
The HR manager selects and reviews the records from the personnel file for employees who are due for their annual review. The HR manager puts some basic employee information on a three-part review form and gives it to the appropriate supervisor for evaluation. The supervisor completes and signs the form, files a copy, and gives the remaining copies to the production supervisor, who reviews and signs the evaluation. The production supervisor returns it to the HR manager. The HR manager reviews it with the controller. They assign a new rate and sign the review form given to the division accountant.

3.0 Payroll Process
The division accountant uses the new employee information and the employee review form to prepare payroll action notices. The accountant signs the payroll action notices and files them by date with the other related forms. Each week, a clerk in the corporate payroll department retrieves the payroll forms from the division accountant, checks the signature on all payroll action notices, and processes the payroll. The forms, checks, and reports are sent back to the division accountant. The division accountant refiles the forms and distributes the checks to employees.
